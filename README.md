# odin_calculator

-tried to style it in theme of EVA02 & Asuka from N.G.E 
-maybe i'll add image in the background

Possible adds in the future:
    - side display showing history of presses
    - animation on the display for big numbers(numbers resize and eventually become exponents)

TODO:
    - optimize code, i think i can make it all work from a single class
